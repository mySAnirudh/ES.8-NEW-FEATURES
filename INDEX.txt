  This chapter focusses on the new features in ES8.
Padding a String
ES8 introduces two string handling functions for padding a string. These functions can be 
used to add space or any desired set of characters to the beginning and end of a string 
value.
String. padStart()
This function pads the current string with a given input string repeatedly from the start, 
till the current string reaches the given length. The syntax of the padStart() function is 
given below:
Syntax
string_value.padStart(targetLength [, padString])
The padStart() function accepts two parameters which are as follows:
 targetLength: A numeric value that represents the target length of the string after 
padding. If the value of this parameter is lesser than or equal to the existing length 
of the string, the string value is returned as it is.
 padString: This is an optional parameter. This parameter specifies the 
characters that should be used to pad the string. The string value is padded with 
spaces if no value is passed to this parameter.
Example
The following example declares a string variable, product_cost. The variable will be padded 
with zeros from left until the total length of the string is seven. The example also illustrates 
behaviour of the padStart() function, if no value is passed to the second parameter.
